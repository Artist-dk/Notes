## Cyber Security
Cyber security refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyber attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.
## Hacking
Hacking is the act of exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to data. It can be done for various reasons, including financial gain, protest, gathering information, or simply for the challenge.
## Who is a Hacker?
A hacker is an individual who uses their technical skills to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data. Hackers can be motivated by a variety of reasons, including profit, protest, information gathering, or the thrill of the challenge.
## What is Ethical Hacking?
Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system, application, or data. Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, perform security assessments to improve the security of an organization's systems and networks.
## Types of Hackers
- Black hat: These are malicious hackers who break into systems for personal gain or to inflict harm.
- Grey hat: These hackers may break into systems without permission but then report the vulnerabilities to the owner, sometimes requesting a fee to fix the issue.
- White hat: Also known as ethical hackers, they are employed to test and ensure the security of an organization's systems.

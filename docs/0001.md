## `ls` Commands

### Basic Commands
- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls [directory]`: List files and directories in the specified directory.

### Options
- `ls -a`: List all files, including hidden files.
- `ls -A`: List all files except `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory).
- `ls -l`: List files in long format, showing detailed information.
- `ls -h`: With `-l`, print sizes in human-readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G).
- `ls -r`: Reverse the order while sorting.
- `ls -R`: Recursively list subdirectories.
- `ls -d`: List directories themselves, not their contents.
- `ls -t`: Sort by modification time, newest first.
- `ls -S`: Sort by file size, largest first.
- `ls -X`: Sort by extension.
- `ls -1`: List one file per line.
- `ls -Q`: Enclose entry names in double quotes.
- `ls -i`: Print the index number (inode) of each file.
- `ls -n`: With `-l`, list numeric UID and GID.
- `ls -o`: With `-l`, list without group information.
- `ls -c`: With `-l`, sort by and show ctime (time of last modification of file status information).
- `ls -u`: With `-l`, sort by and show access time.
- `ls --color`: Colorize the output.
- `ls --full-time`: With `-l`, list full date and time.
- `ls --group-directories-first`: Group directories before files.
- `ls --time-style`: With `-l`, show times using specified style (e.g., `full-iso`, `long-iso`, etc.).

### Combining Options
- `ls -al`: List all files in long format.
- `ls -lh`: List files in long format with human-readable file sizes.
- `ls -lt`: List files sorted by modification time in long format.
- `ls -lrt`: List files sorted by modification time in reverse order in long format.
- `ls -lS`: List files sorted by size in long format.
- `ls -lhS`: List files sorted by size in long format with human-readable file sizes.

### Examples
- `ls`: Basic listing of current directory.
- `ls -a`: List all files, including hidden ones, in the current directory.
- `ls -lh`: Long listing with human-readable file sizes.
- `ls -lt`: Long listing sorted by modification time.
- `ls -laR`: Recursively list all files, including hidden ones, in all subdirectories.
- `ls -d */`: List only directories in the current directory.

By using these `ls` commands, you can effectively navigate and manage directories and files in Unix-like operating systems. Experiment with different combinations of options to find the output format that best suits your needs.



# `cd` Command Reference

The `cd` (change directory) command is used to navigate between directories in a command-line interface. Below is a comprehensive guide to the `cd` command and its various uses.

## Basic Usage

- `cd [directory]`
  - Changes the current directory to `[directory]`.
  - Example: `cd /home/user/documents`

## Special Directory Symbols

- `cd ~`
  - Changes to the user's home directory.
  - Equivalent to `cd /home/username` (on Unix-like systems) or `cd C:\Users\Username` (on Windows).

- `cd ..`
  - Moves up one level in the directory hierarchy.
  - Example: If you are in `/home/user/documents`, `cd ..` will take you to `/home/user`.

- `cd .`
  - Refers to the current directory.
  - Using `cd .` will not change the directory, but it can be used in scripts or commands to explicitly denote the current directory.

- `cd -`
  - Changes to the previous directory.
  - Example: If you were in `/home/user/documents` and changed to `/var/log`, `cd -` will take you back to `/home/user/documents`.

## Absolute and Relative Paths

- **Absolute Path**
  - A complete path from the root directory.
  - Example: `cd /var/log`

- **Relative Path**
  - A path relative to the current directory.
  - Example: If you are in `/home/user`, `cd documents` will take you to `/home/user/documents`.

## Directory Navigation

- `cd /`
  - Changes to the root directory of the filesystem.

- `cd [path/to/directory]`
  - Changes to a specific directory using a relative or absolute path.
  - Example: `cd /home/user/projects`

## Combining Commands

- `cd .. && cd ..`
  - Moves up two levels in the directory hierarchy.

- `cd /home/user/documents && ls`
  - Changes to `/home/user/documents` and then lists its contents.

## Notes

- Commands and behaviors may vary slightly between Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.
- Use `pwd` (print working directory) to verify the current directory.

## Example Commands

```bash
# Change to home directory
cd ~

# Go up one directory level
cd ..

# Change to a specific directory
cd /usr/local/bin

# Go back to the previous directory
cd -

# Move up two directory levels and list contents
cd ../.. && ls
```

## Linux Commands
```
# Get user-name
$ whoami

# You will get 'root' as output after executing below
$ sudo whoami

# change directory
$ cd

# list files and folders
$ ls
$ ls -a
$ ls -l
$ ls -la



# Current working directory
$ pwd


```

## Find files
You can use anyone command to find files. To find folders you can use 'whereis' command only.
```
whereis [filename/foldername]
locate [filename]
```
